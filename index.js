// In Visual Studio Code, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below and ensures that the code compiles and runs as directed.
// Comment your code, to prove that you understand what you have written -- this is required!
// Create a new repository on GitHub for this week's assignments and push your code to the repository.
// Record and Upload a Video showcasing your assignment.
// Keep Track of the URLs for this week's GitHub repository and Video upload.
// Start the Quiz to submit your assignment.
// Put the URL for your GitHub repo into the Quiz
// Put the URL for your Video into the Quiz
// Answer the questions
// Coding Steps:
// Create a menu app as seen in this weekâ€™s video. What you create is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements:
// Use at least one array.
// Use at least two classes.
// Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.
// Video Steps:
// Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.
// This video should be done using screen share and voice over.
// This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend.
// You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording.
// This will create a video recording on your computer.
// This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube.
// Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!
// If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.

//Class Car
class Car{ //constructor 1, make and model
    constructor(make, model){ //the constructor takes in the make and model parameters
        this.make = make; //this line assigns the make parameter
        this.model = model; //this line assigns the model parameter
    }
}
 // The Car class is used to create car objects with make and model properties and represnts the basic structure of a car in our inventory.

//Class Menu
class Menu { //constructor 2, contains the array of cars and all methods to manage the car inventory
    constructor() { //this constructor initializes an empty array to store the cars
        this.cars = []; //this is the empty array
    }
    

    //add a car to the menu
    addCar(){ //adds a new car by prompting the user to input a make and a model
        let carMake = prompt("Enter Car Make"); //allows the user to enter the car make
        let carModel = prompt("Enter Car Model"); //allows the user to enter the car model
        this.cars.push(new Car(carMake, carModel)); //this function pushed the new make + model into the list, so if I push "this.cars.push(new car(carMake, carModel));" it will display "carMake carModel"
    }

    //delete cars from the menu
    deleteCar(){ //deletes a car by prompting the user to input an index to remove a car(0,1,2,3,4...)

        this.cars.splice(carIndex, 1); //this is the splice method that removes the specified index
    }
    //view cars from the menu
    viewCars(){ //this will show the cars in the inventory as an alert
        let displayCars = ''; //initialize an empty string to store the car list display
        for (let i = 0; i < this.cars.length; i++) { 
            displayCars += `${i}) ${this.cars[i].make} ${this.cars[i].model}\n`; //make and model will be printed in the inventory list and then \n will add a new line for another listed item/car.    
        }
